This is my personal website I created to continue to develop my frontend skills.

It consists of three pages with consistent navigation. The home page consists of my name, title,
my desk setup, and one of my wow factors which is a greeting based on the date time of day. The
about page consists of my education and some of my technical skills with some logos for languages
and frameworks I have used. The projects page consists of a link to my GitHub page and a link to
my GitHub projects.

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

In order to update this website, someone would need to visit this public GitHub repository
https://github.com/DavidArakelian/P1-COMP5130 and fork it. Then the user can create a pull
request with the user's new changes.
